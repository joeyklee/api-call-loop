# api-call-loop

this is a little example of using `promises`, `async`, and `await` to loop through and make api calls.

Please see in-line code comments for documentation.

NOTE: prepared as an example for the Quant Humanist course at ITP // for doing batch reverse geocoding 

## pre-step:

to run this example you will need a mapbox API key. Please go to mapbox.com and signup to get an `access token`

## run

```
$ npm install
$ node index.js
# you should get a file with an ARRAY written to your folder: 'filtered-and-geocoded-locations.json'
```
